To begin the lab, I ran ``hash_value.py`` twice to compare the results.

After this, I ran snakecoin through one terminal, and generated a transaction through another.

## YourNet

I ran ``node_server.py`` and ``run_app.py`` in two different terminals and accessed the server through the localhoust route.

I chose a message, which was 14-line sonnet about my friend Gustavo.
