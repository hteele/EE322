# LAB 3
-----------------------------------
## Installing Packages

Before I ran the necessary commands, I began by installing the required packages for this lab (jdcal, astral, geopy, and psutils)
### jdcall installation
![jdcal install](pictures/jdcal.png)
### astral installation
![astral install](pictures/astral.png)
### geopy installation
![geopy install](pictures/geopy.png)
### psutils installation
![psutils install](pictures/psutils.png)

While installing these I encountered an issue running any .py file. I figured out this was due to the multiple versions of Python installed on my laptop. To fix this, I simply pasted the path before executing the .py file as follows:

`C:\PATH TO\Python\Python311\python.exe julian.py`
